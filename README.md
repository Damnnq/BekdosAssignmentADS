## Algorithms & Data Structures: Function and Recursion Problem Solutions

## Introduction
This project presents solutions to 10 algorithmic problems using core principles of functional programming and recursion. These problems cover fundamental topics such as prime checking, factorial computation, Fibonacci sequences, and binomial coefficients. The solutions demonstrate recursive approaches to solving computational problems effectively.

## Assignment Documentation
This project implements requirements from the [Laboratory1 (2).pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19510042/Laboratory1.2.pdf) provided by [Senior-lecturer Khaimuldin Nursultan].

## Problem Descriptions
1. Find Minimum: Given an array of "n" elements, return the minimum value.
2. Find Average: Given an array of "n" elements, return the average value.
3. Prime Check: Check whether a given number "n" is prime.
4. Factorial Calculation: Compute "n!" using recursion.
5. Fibonacci Sequence: Find the "n"-th element in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.
6. Exponentiation: Compute "a^n" for given numbers "a" and "n".
7. Reverse Array (Without Array Data Structure): Reverse a given array recursively.
8. Digit Check: Determine if a given string "s" consists entirely of digits.
9. Binomial Coefficient: Compute C(n, k) using Pascalâ€™s triangle formula.
10. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD): Find GCD(a, b) using the Euclidean Algorithm.
